# 2. Analyzing the users

### User 1: Ana
Ana is a 34 year old banker from New York City. She leads a fast-paced lifestyle and needs to keep track of the financial markets every day for her work. She is a high-strung, no-nonsense person who wants to get the information she wants, right when she wants it. She has a high spending capacity and is willing to spend money on solutions that make her life more comfortable and efficient. Ana commutes to work in taxis and makes the most of her commute by catching up on the overnight movements in the stock market and the world news through Bloomberg and Wall Street Journal videos on her smartphone. While she has a high degree of technical proficiency, she prefers using Siri and speech-to-text systems to interface with the device instead of using the phoneâ€™s keyboard. In her free time, she enjoys traveling and going on outdoor excursions to remote parts of the exotic countries she visits. Sometimes there is no cellular data in these remote locations, which greatly irritates Ana. She would like to be able to see the travel and excursion videos that she watched before her trip, during her trip so that she can be reminded of what to visit and where to go during her vacation.


### User 2: Tom
Tom is a 21 year old student. He studies Political Science at Carlos III University of Madrid. He needs an easy way to stay informed about the latest world news and have access to the most important television news channels. Furthermore, in some classes, he is required to see conferences and speeches of politicians. On the other hand, he enjoys watching other types of videos for entertainment, such as late night shows and Stand-up comedy. Additionally, he likes watching TV series and films in his free time. Tom lives in a shared room in the center of Madrid and since his studies take up a lot of his time he cannot work, so he appreciates web pages where he can find the information that he needs as fast as possible and where there is no need to pay for a premium account to obtain good services. It takes him more than 1 hour to commute to the university every day and he wants to use that time productively. At home he does not have a TV, but he has a good internet connection that allows him to use his devices as a TV, although when he is outside his cellphone connection is limited. He is interested in new technologies and it is not a problem for him to use a new web site even if it is complex, but since he spends a lot of time in front of a screen, he prefers web pages where everything is distributed in a clear and harmonious way that does not tire his eyes. He is looking for a web page for watching videos where he can find both academic and entertaining videos and that can be used for seeing TV channels.


### User 3: Laura
Laura is a 66 year old grandmother, who is retired and likes to spend as much time with her three grandchildren, Robert (age 3), Samuel (age 5), and Paula (age 6). She typically takes care of her grandchildren after school while their parents are busy at work. In doing so, she usually cooks dinner for her grandchildren while they watch videos on her computer in the living room. When she is not taking care of her grandchildren, Laura likes to learn about war histories, which occasionally involves watching graphic war films on her computer. She worries that her grandchildren might see this graphic content when using her computer. Furthermore, she is only interested in films and videos in English because it is the only language that she knows and she is not able to read subtitles. Laura uses glasses and does most of her history learning through online videos and multimedia, since her poor eyesight makes it difficult for her to read. To this end, she uses websites with large text and navigational tools in order to watch her videos and films. Moreover, sometimes she is unable to use certain websites because they are too complicated for her to understand. She does not understand how a payout via internet works and does not trust on spending her money on web sites. An important problem for her in most web pages is the invasive advertising as she is not able to distinguish between real and fake information and this put in risk her devices security. When a problem occurs or she cannot find something, she has to wait until her son visits her. She dislikes depending on him all the time so she likes sites where she can easily find a trusted phone number to contact customer support, but she has to be very sure that the calls are going to be for free and that she is going to be attended by a human and not a machine.
